# Portfolio-Brischster

## Portfolio of Current and Future Works

This is my first attempt at creating a portfolio that I will use to showcase projects/code that I write during and after my bootcamp. Hopefully this will allow me to showcase my skills and interest to prospective employers. This will be a living document that I will continue to update, improve and tweak.
